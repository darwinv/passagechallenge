# üëã  Welcome to the Passage Challenge Solved 

I'm not sure it's bug free, :ant: but surely I did my best :bowtie: 


## Backend

It was made with Python :snake:, in order to run it, you just need to have Python >= 3.8.

the `good_square.py` is where the solution resides. 

You can execute it with the example that it is in the source like this
`python good_square.py`

```
# Example usage:
matrix_ex = [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
]
``` 
the output in the console should be **14**, the amount of good squares in that matrix.

modify the matrix at your will üëå




### Unit tests

There's also a file that executes unit tests with different scenarios and corner cases against `good_square.py`.

you can execute them running, :point_right: `python -m unittest test_good_square.py`. 

No need to install or configure anything. üß∞


## Frontend

The Type practicing app was made in just one file, **type_app.html**.


In order to execute it, you just need to download the file and open it with a recent browser preferably.


Once you open the file, your typing speed starts counting. ‚è≥

if you close the window, the application will save where your last checkpoint was. :floppy_disk:


if your typing speed is below **25 wpm** there will raise a pop up, and request to restart the lesson or finish everything and show the final results


Unfortunately, I couldn't add unit tests for this one :sweat: 



PS: In case I don't pass the challenge, a well-detailed feedback will be much appreciated, Thanks :innocent: :v:
