# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Passage Challenge Solved by me :bowtie:

I'm not sure it's bug free, :ant: but I did my best in the short time I had.


## Backend

It was made with Python :snake:, in order to run it, you just need to have Python >= 3.8.

the `good_square.py` is where the solution resides. 

You can execute it with the example that it is in the source like this
`python good_square.py`

```
# Example usage:
matrix_ex = [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
]
```
